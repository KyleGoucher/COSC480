# COSC480
My full year project for COSC480 at University of Otago, in my Postgraduate year. 
This project is predicting robot movement, based off motor controls,using different neural networks, Autoencoder/decoder and generative adversarial network. This includes V-REP libraries.

Current Progress:
Adapted a robot model to a 4DOF model (currently cannot find link)
Programmed remote api control via python which sets random joint positions and vision sensor captures movement


To Do:

implement  AutoEncoder/Decoder network to use images and motor commands for prediction
implement  Generative adversarial network to do the same.
